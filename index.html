            Elvin Eng is a working professional currently in the biotechnology industry and has been working in this field since late 2008. The work specializes in biologics manufacturing with a focus on operations, process equipment, validation, and quality systems. Throughout this career journey opportunities permitted work in many places around the world, either dealing with other site locations or vendor facilities. This industry is constantly evolving to keep up with technological changes and business practices which leaves the work in-demand.

            Elvin is a Massachusetts native from a small town near the MA/RI border called the "south-coast". He went to college to study Biomedical Engineering at RPI in Troy, NY. From then relocated back to MA to the city of Cambridge to work with the first and only company throughout his career. It wasn't until re-organization of the company occurred in 2015 which led to the decision of relocating to RTP, NC.

            Since then, Elvin is embarking on this Enneagram Type 9 journey and fulfilling this touch of full stack development can help with the identification of skill application. Problem solving and creative thinking has always been a pursuit of the mind. Fine tuning and extending these skills will enable either specialization in the current field or new lines of work to explore. Whatever it is, the journey awaits.
